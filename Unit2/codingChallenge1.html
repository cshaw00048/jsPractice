      Mark and John are trying to compair their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
      calculated using the formula BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height *
      height) (mass in kg and heigh in meter). Your tasks: 1. Store Mark's and
      John's mass and height variables. 2. Calculate both their BMIs using the
      formula (you can even implement both versions) 3. Create a Boolean
      variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about whether Mark has a
      higher BMI than John. Test Data: - Data 1: Mark weighs 78 kg and is 1.69 m
      tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall. - Data 2: Mark weighs 95 kg
      and is 1.88 m tall. John weighs 85 kg and is 1.76 m tall.

      const heightJohn = 1.95;
