/*********************
*Coding Challenge 2
*/

John and Mike both play basketbal on different 
teams. In the latest 3 games, John's team scored 89,
120, and 103 points, while Mike's team scored 116, 94
and 123 points.

1. Calculate the average score for each teams
2. Decide which team's wins in average (highest)
average score), and print the winner to the console.
Also include the average score in the output.
3. Then change the scores to show different winners.
Don't forget to take into account there might be a 
draw (the same average score)

4. Extra: Mary also plays basketball and her team
scored 97, 134, and 105 points. Like before, log
the average winner to the console. HINT: You will need
the && operator to take the decision. 
5. Like before, change the scores to generate
different winners, keeping in mind there might be
draws.
