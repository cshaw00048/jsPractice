        /*John and his family went on a holiday and went to 3
        different restaurants. The bills were $124, $48 and
        $268.

        To tip the waiter a fair amount, John created a
        simple tip calculator (as a function). He likes to
        tip 20% of the bill when the bill is less than $50,
        15% when the bill is between $50 and $200, and 10%
        if the bill is more than $200.

        In the end, John would like to have 2 arrays.
        1) Containing all three tips (one for each bill).
        2) Containing all three final paid amounts (bill + tip).

        (NOTE: To calculate 20% of a value = 20/100 = 0.2)
        */

        // var billTip = [(124 * 15/100), (48 * 20/100), (268 * 10/100)];
        // console.log(billTip);

        // var total = [124 + billTip[0], 48 + billTip[1], 268 + billTip[2]];
        // console.log(total)

        function tipCalculator(bill) {
            var percentage;
            if (bill < 50) {
                percentage = .2;
            }else if (bill >= 50 && bill < 200) {
                percentage = .15;
            } else {
                percentage = .1;
            }

            return percentage * bill;
        }

        var bills = [124, 48, 268];
        var tips = [tipCalculator(bills[0]),
                    tipCalculator(bills[1]),
                    tipCalculator(bills[2])];

        var finalValues = [bills[0] + tips[0],
                            bills[1] + tips[1],
                            bills[2] + tips[2]];
                
            console.log(tips, finalValues);
