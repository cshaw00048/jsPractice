        /*John and his family went on a holiday and went to 3
        different restaurants. The bills were $124, $48 and
        $268.

        To tip the waiter a fair amount, John created a
        simple tip calculator (as a function). He likes to
        tip 20% of the bill when the bill is less than $50,
        15% when the bill is between $50 and $200, and 10%
        if the bill is more than $200.

        In the end, John would like to have 2 arrays.
        1) Containing all three tips (one for each bill).
        2) Containing all three final paid amounts (bill + tip).

        (NOTE: To calculate 20% of a value = 20/100 = 0.2)
